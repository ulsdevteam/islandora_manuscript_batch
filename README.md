# Islandora Manuscript Batch

## Introduction

This module was written from a copy of the islandora_book_batch module to provide nearly identical functionality for ingesting manuscript objects.

This module implements a batch framework for importing manuscripts into Islandora.

The ingest is a two-step process:

* Preprocessing: The data is scanned and a number of entries are created in the
  Drupal database.  There is minimal processing done at this point, so preprocessing can
  be completed outside of a batch process.
* Ingest: The data is actually processed and ingested. This happens inside of
  a Drupal batch.

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Islandora](https://github.com/islandora/islandora)
* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)
* [Islandora Batch](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch)
* [Manuscript Solution Pack](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_solution_pack_manuscript)


# Installation

Install as usual, see [this](https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7) for further information.

## Configuration

N/A

## Documentation

Further documentation for this module is available at [our wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA/How+to+Batch+Ingest+Files).

### Usage

The base ZIP/directory preprocessor can be called as a drush script (see `drush help islandora_manuscript_batch_preprocess` for additional parameters):

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_manuscript_batch_preprocess --type=zip --target=/path/to/archive.zip`

This will populate the queue (stored in the Drupal database) with base entries.

Manuscripts must be broken up into separate directories, such that each directory at the "top" level (in the target directory or Zip file) represents a manuscript. Manuscript pages are their own directories inside of each manuscript directory.

Files are assigned to object datastreams based on their basename, so a folder structure like:

* my_cool_manuscript/
    * MODS.xml
    * 1/
        * OBJ.tiff
    * 2/
        * OBJ.tiff

would result in a two-page manuscript object.

Each page directory name will be used as the sequence number of the page created.

A file named --METADATA--.xml can contain either MODS, DC or MARCXML which is used to fill in the MODS or DC streams (if not provided explicitly). Similarly, --METADATA--.mrc (containing binary MARC) will be transformed to MODS and then possibly to DC, if neither are provided explicitly.

If no MODS is provided at the manuscript level - either directly as MODS.xml, or transformed from either a DC.xml or the "--METADATA--" file discussed above - the directory name will be used as the title.

The queue of preprocessed items can then be processed:

`drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_ingest`

### Customization

Custom ingests can be written by [extending](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch/wiki/How-To-Extend) any of the existing preprocessors and batch object implementations.
